        <h2>International Trade and Procurement Services</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Magnate International is engaged in the business of procuring materials and supplies to end users in the manufacturing and construction industries.  We have developed relationships globally with international brokers, manufacturers and material suppliers that we can leverage to procure products utilized in these companyâ€™s operations.  </p>
        
        <p>We work with end users to identify RFPs that we are qualified to fulfill and can provide competitive pricing and/or differentiated products or services.  If an RFP meets these requirements, we prepare a bid and work through the submission process.  The bidding process can include multiple revisions as we refine our proposal to meet specific product or delivery requirements.  Once awarded a bid, we then leverage our supplier relationships to fulfill the RFP.  </p>

        <p>Fulfillment of each project requires a myriad of actions to ensure the product meets specifications and is delivered when needed.  These actions include securing LOCs, arranging freight and insurance, inspecting product or material, and managing customs.  </p>

        <p>Our typical client manages very complex supply chains, or in the case of construction, complicated projects with demanding time constraints.  Our ability to source materials globally at competitive prices streamlines their operation.  We aim to provide quality products and reliable service in a turnkey procurement solution.</p>
